# Import Visual Studio Settings

Settings should be automatically synchronized across visual studio via signing into `west.ryan.k@gmail.com`.
However, if that doesn't work, you can restore your settings using the included file by opening Visual Studio 
and selecting `Tools > Import and Export Settings...` then following the wizard.
